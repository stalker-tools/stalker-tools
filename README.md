# Hi, s.t.r.a.n.g.e.r.

## Welcome to stalker x-ray game engine tools

Primary goal of this work is analysis of game and mods by **table**-based and **graph**-based view of game _.lxt_ and _.xml_ files.

It can be handle to _game designer_ and _game testers_. See [tools](https://github.com/stalker-tools/tools) repo and example of [analysis](https://github.com/stalker-tools/real_weapons_mod_clear_sky) repo with [Real weapons mod](https://github.com/stalker-tools/real_weapons_mod_clear_sky/releases) releases page.

Also there is **text**-based analysis with batch editing of _.lxt_ files with according to format: [section] lvalue = rvalue (see tools/ltx_tool.py).
